# 1PiNV1
## Budget NVD project

### software forked from rpi-goggles, case designed by me, name inspired by the 1PN51

## this readme is a work in progress, as I am still populating it with my files for this project.

A night-vision device (NVD), also known as night optical/observation device (NOD) and night-vision goggles (NVG), is an optoelectronic device that allows images to be produced in levels of light approaching total darkness.

Your average helmet mount NVD is priced out of reach for the average individual, so this project is a test to attempt to create an affordable helmet mounted NVD for the average individual or the curious tinkerer.

Case files listed as 2x need to be printed twice, and everything else only needs to be printed once.

## Hardware Ver1 (current test):
### - RPi 3 
### - noir camera (arducam B003503)
### - 3.5 Inch HDMI (UCTRONICS)(480*320)
### - 1 Ximimark Micro USB 18650 battery expansion shield + battery, uncased
### - My pi case design, but no helmet mount

## Ver2 will consist of:
- 2x RPi 0W
- 2x noir camera (arducam B003503)
- 2x 3.5 Inch HDMI (UCTRONICS)(480*320)
- 2x Ximimark Micro USB 18650 battery expansion shield + batteries, no enclosure
- the complete pi case design and the helmet mount

## Ver3 is expected to be:
- 2x RPi 0W
- 2x noir camera (arducam B003503)
- 2x 3.5 Inch HDMI (UCTRONICS)(480*320)
- 2x Ximimark Micro USB 18650 battery expansion shield + batteries
- the complete pi case design, battery enclosure, and the helmet mount, all mounted to a helmet for testing

## Notes:
- test: RPi 3b+ (1-5% cpu usage)
- test: RPi 0W (5-10% cpu usage)
- Display is HDMI (there seems to be lag issues when using Display Connector DSI, or GPIO)
